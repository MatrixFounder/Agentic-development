# Market Strategy: Vertical Video for Seniors (60+)

## 1. Core Thesis
A specialized short-form video platform (TikTok clone) designed specifically for the 60+ demographic, featuring larger UI, curated content, and simplified navigation.

## 2. Market Sizing
- **TAM:** ~$100B (Global Short-form video market).
- **SAM:** $5–8B (60+ audience segment, adjusted for lower ad rates).
- **SOM:** <$50M (Very low adoption rate expected).
- **CAGR:** 10% (Demographic is growing, but tech adoption is slow).

## 3. Timing & Macro Trends
- **Why now?**
    - *Negative Signal:* TikTok/Facebook/YouTube Shorts have already captured this market. Seniors prefer platforms where their families are (Facebook).
    - No strong trigger or technological shift favoring a separate app.

## 4. Competitive Landscape
| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Our Edge |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Facebook** | Massive installed base of 60+ | Cluttered UI | "Cleaner" UI (Weak differentiator) |
| **TikTok** | Best algo, infinite content | Too fast-paced, small text | "Slow Mode" |
| **YouTube** | Long-form content | Ads | None |

## 5. Moat & Defensibility
- **Moat:** Virtually non-existent. Content is easily copied.
- **Defensibility Score:** 1/10.

## 6. Key Risks & Adversarial Critique
- **Critique 1:** **Adoption Barrier.** Asking 60+ users to download a *new* app is extremely difficult.
- **Critique 2:** **Monetization.** ARPU for this demographic is historically lower on ad-supported models compared to Gen Z/Millennials.
- **Critique 3:** **Content Supply.** Creators go where the eyeballs are (TikTok). Chicken-and-egg problem.

## 7. Strategic Verdict
- **Overall Score:** 28/100
- **Recommendation:** **No-Go** — Terrible timing, massive adoption friction, and no defensible moat against incumbents like Facebook. This has "Quibi" written all over it.
