# Product Vision: Agentic IDE

## 1. Problem Statement
**The Problem:** Developers spend 40% of their time on boilerplate and context switching, leading to burnout and low velocity. Existing AI tools are "chatty" and lack deep context awareness.

## 2. Target Audience
**Who is this for?** Senior Software Engineers and Technical Founders who value detailed architectural control but want to offload execution.

## 3. Solution & Value
**The Solution:** An Agentic IDE that integrates directly with the file system and project lifecycle. It strictly separates "Architecture" (Design) from "Execution" (Coding), allowing one engineer to act as a Tech Lead for multiple AI agents.

## 4. Success Metrics (KPIs)
- Reduce boilerplate creation time by 80%.
- Maintain < 5% hallucination rate on file paths.
- Achieve 90% "One-Shot" success on TIER 2 tasks.

## 5. Timeline (Rough)
- **Phase 0:** Bootstrap (Core Scripts)
- **Phase 1:** MVP (CLI Agent)
